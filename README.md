# Advanced Driving Stability System For Formula Students Cars
This project showcases a predictive machine learning system designed to prevent loss-of-control incidents in a Formula Student race car. By leveraging real-time vehicle dynamics data, the system anticipates and actively corrects for understeer and oversteer, enhancing vehicle stability and performance on the track
